# DelphiReSym – A Delphi Symbol Name Recovery Tool for Reverse Engineers

_DelphiReSym_ is a reverse engineering utility that reconstructs **fully qualified Delphi symbol names** from after-compilation metadata embedded in Delphi executables. This includes function names, return types, parameter types, and parameter names.

_DelphiReSym_ is designed for use with **Ghidra** (via `pyghidra`) and aims to ease the reverse engineering process of Delphi malware and legacy applications by restoring as much human-readable semantic context as possible.

> ⚠️ **Limitations**:
>
> * The tool only works on **unpacked** Delphi binaries. Packed binaries will most likely not contain accessible metadata. Use a service like [UnpacMe by OALabs](https://www.unpac.me/) if needed.
> * Internal Delphi types are currently mapped to generic pointers for readability only.





## ✅ Supported Delphi Versions

_DelphiReSym_ supports the following Delphi versions, which share compatible metadata formats:

* Delphi 2009 *(not sure if this version is supported -> couldn't be tested due to lack of 2009 binaries)*
* Delphi 2010
* Delphi XE
* Delphi XE2
* Delphi XE3
* Delphi XE4
* Delphi XE5
* Delphi XE6
* Delphi XE7
* Delphi XE8
* Delphi 10 Seattle
* Delphi 10.1 Berlin
* Delphi 10.2 Tokyo
* Delphi 10.3 Rio
* Delphi 10.4 Sydney
* Delphi 11 Alexandria
* Delphi 12 Athens


Versions beyond Delphi 12 **may** work, **provided** they retain the same compiler metadata format.





## 🧪 How to Find Out if My Delphi Executable Version is Supported?

You can try using the [DIE (Detect It Easy)](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy) tool to get a rough guess of the Delphi version. However, the most reliable approach is to **simply run the tool** – if the version is unsupported, it will fail immediately, before any changes are made to your Ghidra project.





## ⚙️ Why is My Delphi Version Not Supported?

Certain Delphi versions use **incompatible metadata formats**, which are not yet supported by this tool.
The visual timeline illustrates the assumed format divergences, under the assumption that Delphi 2009 is not supported. Sections marked **red** and **yellow** in that timeline are unsupported and might have a more fine-grained format change history.

## 💻 Requirements

* Ghidra (version **11.3 or newer**, for bundled `pyghidra` support)
* A working **Python 3 interpreter**
* [`pyghidra`](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/Ghidra_11.3_build/Ghidra/Configurations/Public_Release/src/global/docs/WhatsNew.md#pyghidra) must be properly configured and used to run the script





## 🛠️ Usage Guide

1. **Start Ghidra with `pyghidra`**:
   Run Ghidra using the pyghidra-specific launcher from $GHIDRA_HOME:

   * On Windows:
     `.\support\pyghidraRun.bat`
   * On Linux/macOS:
     `./support/pyghidraRun`

2. **Import the binary you want to analyse and open it in Ghidra's CodeBrowser** (🐉 button).

3. **(Optional)**: Let Ghidra complete its **Auto Analysis**.
   The tool has been tested post-analysis without issues. Executing it Pre-Auto-Analysis, the statistics of _DelphiReSym_ upon successful execution might be incorrectly inflated.

4. **Load the Script**:

   * Download the script from this repo's [releases](https://github.com/WenzWenzWenz/DelphiReSym/releases/tag/latest_version) or alternatively from [src](https://github.com/WenzWenzWenz/DelphiReSym/blob/main/src/ghidra_scripts/DelphiReSym.py).
   * Go to **Window > Script Manager** (green ▶️ button).
   * Click the **"Manage Script Directories"** button (the button which looks like an itemize symbol).
   * Add the folder containing the downloaded `DelphiReSym.py` via the green ➕ icon.
   * Close the bundle manager.

5. **Run the Tool**:

   * Locate the script "DelphiReSym.py" in the Script Manager list (bundled in the "Delphi" directory).
   * Click it, then press the **green ▶️ button** ("Run Script").
   * If the imported binary is supported, a progress bar and status messages will appear in the Ghidra console.





## 📈 Evaluation

On real-world Delphi malware samples (of supported versions), the tool achieved the following recovery rates:

* **Function names & return types**:
  Between **31.56%** and **54.23%** successfully reconstructed.

* **Parameter sets** (complete lists of `(name, type)` tuples for each function):
  Between **27.31%** and **47.80%** reconstructed.
  *Note*: The actual accuracy for total parameter **tuples** is higher, since each function may have multiple parameters.


## 📝 TODO

- [ ] Increase coverage of Delphi versions:
   - [ ] Finish format analysis. Initial format analysis for Delphi versions *Delphi 2* through *Delphi 2006* has been conducted (hopefully works for *Delphi 2007* as well).
   - [ ] Evaluate efficacy for old samples of Malware families.
   - [ ] Integrate logging functionality for errors.
- [ ] Enhance script's general prettiness ✨
- [ ] Integrate Ghidra headless mode (https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/Ghidra/Features/PyGhidra/src/main/py/README.md)
- [ ] Update ">" "<>" RTTI_Class name parsing.
- [ ] Feature: replace typecasts with actual RTTI datatype structures (credit goes to [@huettenhain](https://github.com/huettenhain)!)



## 📌 Disclaimer

This is a research tool and work in progress. While it can significantly assist reverse engineering tasks, it may yield yet unknown errors. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
